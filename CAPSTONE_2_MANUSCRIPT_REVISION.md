# CAPSTONE 2 MANUSCRIPT REVISION
## Modernizing Barangay Services: A Web-Based Centralized Reporting and Complaint Management System for Davao City Barangays

### UPDATED ABSTRACT

In today's fast-paced digital age, local government units (LGUs) are expected to modernize their systems to provide transparent, efficient, and citizen-centered services. However, many barangays in Davao City still rely on traditional, manual methods to manage public complaints, leading to delays, poor tracking, and lack of community trust. This study presents the development and deployment of a fully functional web-based, centralized reporting and complaint management system designed to serve all barangays in Davao City.

**CAPSTONE 2 ENHANCEMENTS:**
The system has been significantly enhanced with advanced security features, mobile optimization, and real-time communication capabilities. Key improvements include:

- **Enhanced Security**: Multi-factor authentication with email verification, secure password management with show/hide functionality, and comprehensive admin activity logging
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with mobile-specific password field improvements, touch-optimized interfaces, and cross-device compatibility
- **Real-time Communication**: Integrated chat system between residents and barangay officials with instant notifications
- **Live Deployment**: Successfully deployed at `dvobarangaycms.vip` with Railway cloud hosting and custom domain configuration
- **Advanced User Management**: Role-based access control, admin recovery tools, and comprehensive user profile management
- **Geographic Validation**: Advanced barangay validation system with real-time verification against Davao City's 182 barangays database
- **GPS Integration**: Intelligent location detection with cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Safari) and accurate boundary validation
- **Complaint Forwarding**: Multi-level complaint escalation system with forwarding to higher government agencies
- **Resolution Tracking**: Comprehensive complaint lifecycle management with status updates and resolution documentation

The system allows residents to submit complaints online with precise location data through GIS integration, track updates in real-time, and communicate directly with barangay officials through an integrated chat system. Each barangay has its own secure portal with advanced authentication, enabling specific complaint monitoring while maintaining data privacy and security.

Administrators can view complaints through a centralized dashboard with enhanced analytics, prioritize responses with real-time notifications, and manage comprehensive data analytics for improved governance. Built with modern web technologies including Django REST Framework, Supabase PostgreSQL database, and responsive frontend technologies, the system is fully deployed, scalable, user-friendly, and inclusive.

**DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**
The system is now live and operational at `https://dvobarangaycms.vip`, serving as a model for digital transformation in barangay-level governance across Davao City.
